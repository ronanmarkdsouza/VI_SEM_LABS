# Lab-4
1. Write a parallel program using OpenMP to implement the Selection sortalgorithm. Compute the efficiency and plot the speed up for varying input size and thread number.
2. Write a parallel program using openMP to implement the following: Take anarray of input size m. Divide the array into two parts and sort the first  half  using  insertion  sort and  second half  using  quick  sort. Use two threads to perform these tasks. Use mergesort to combine the results of these two sorted arrays.
3. Write a parallel program using OpenMP to implement sequential search algorithm. Compute the efficiency and plot the speed up for varying input size and thread number.
