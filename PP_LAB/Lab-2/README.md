# Lab-2
1. Write a C program to:
  a. Illustrates the fork-join pattern using OpenMP's parallel directive.
  b. Illustrates the fork-join pattern using multiple OpenMP parallel directives and changing the number of threads two ways.
  c. Illustrates the single-program-multiple-data (SPMD) pattern using two basic OpenMP commands.

2. Write a OpenMP program to calculate 𝑝𝑜𝑤(𝑖,𝑥) for all the threads where 𝑖 is an integer value and 𝑥 is the thread_Id.

3. Write a OpenMP program that performs the sum of even numbers and odd numbers in a given input array. Create a separate thread to perform the sum of even numbers and odd numbers.

4. Write a OpenMP program to implement all the four basic operations of a calculator (Add, Sub, Mul, Div). Create a separate thread to perform the operations.

5. Write an OpenMP program to perform Arithmetic operations (Add, Sub, Mul, Div) on two vectors A and B of size 4.

6. Write a OpenMP program for generating prime numbers from a given starting number to the given ending number.

7. Write a program in OpenMP to toggle the character of a given character array indexed by the thread_Id. Print the corresponding Thread_Id.
Example: suppose the string is “HeLLo”, then the output should be “hEllO”.

8. Write a program using OpenMp to compute the Fibonacci number for the following arrays of numbers: A={10, 13, 5, 6}. Create a separate thread to perform the operations.
